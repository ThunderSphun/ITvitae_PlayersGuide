        “Hello, World!”</h2>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="31" data-line-end="37">You open your eyes and find yourself face down on
        the beach of a large island, the waves crashing on the<br>
        shore not far off. A voice nearby calls out, “Hey, you! You’re finally awake!” You sit up and look around.<br>
        Somehow, opening your IDE has pulled you into the Mysterious Realms of Java (not related to the (uncopyrighted)
        name of a certain island in Indonesia), a strange land where<br>
        it appears that you can use Java programming to solve problems. The man comes closer, examining you.<br>
        “Are you okay? Can you speak?” Creating and running a “Hello, World!” program seems like a good way<br>
        to respond.</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="38" data-line-end="39"><strong>Objective:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="39" data-line-end="41">Create a program in your favorite Java IDE
            that prints “Hello World!” to the console, and run it.</li>

        2: What Comes Next</h2>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="46" data-line-end="49">The man seems surprised that you’ve produced a
        working “Hello, World!” program. “Been a while since I<br>
        saw somebody program like that around here. Do you know what you’re doing with that? Can you make<br>
        it do something besides just say ‘hello’?”</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="50" data-line-end="51">Build on your original Hello World program with the
        following:</p>

            id="Challenge_3_The_Makings_of_a_Programmer_56"></a>Challenge 3: The Makings of a Programmer</h2>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="57" data-line-end="67">The man, who tells you his name is Ritlin, asks you
        to follow him over to a few of his friends, fishing on<br>
        the dock. “This one here has the makings of a Programmer!” Ritlin says. The group looks at you with eyes<br>
        widening and mouths agape. Ritlin turns back to you and continues, “I haven’t seen nor heard tell of<br>
        anybody who can wield that power in a million clock cycles of the CPU. Nobody has been able to do that<br>
        since the Uncoded One showed up in these lands.” He describes the shadowy and mysterious Uncoded<br>
        One, an evil power that rots programs and perhaps even the world itself. The Uncoded One’s presence<br>
        has prevented anybody from wielding the power of programming, the only thing that might be able to<br>
        stop it. Yet somehow, you have been able to grab hold of this power anyway. Ritlin’s companions suddenly<br>

        For example, to protect the city block at (Row 6, Column 5), the<br>

        destroyed, or the city will fall. Only by combining Mylara’s prototype, Skorin’s cannon, and your<br>
        programming skills will you have a chance to win this fight. You must build a program that allows one<br>
        user—the pilot of the Manticore—to enter the airship’s range from the city and a second user—the city’s<br>
        defenses—to attempt to find what distance the airship is at and destroy it before it can lay waste to the<br>
        town.</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="488" data-line-end="496">The first user begins by secretly establishing
        how far the Manticore is from the city, in the range 0 to 100.<br>
        The program then allows a second player to repeatedly attempt to destroy the airship by picking the<br>
        range to target until either the city of Consolas or the Manticore is destroyed. In each attempt, the player<br>
        is told if they overshot (too far), fell short (not far enough), or hit the Manticore. The damage dealt to
        the<br>
        Manticore depends on the turn number. For most turns, 1 point of damage is dealt. But if the turn number<br>
        is a multiple of 3, a fire blast deals 3 points of damage; a multiple of 5, an electric blast deals 3 points
        of<br>
        damage, and if it is a multiple of both 3 and 5, a mighty fire-electric blast deals 10 points of damage. The<br>
        Manticore is destroyed after taking 10 points of damage.</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="497" data-line-end="499">However, if the Manticore survives a turn, it
        will deal a guaranteed 1 point of damage to the city of<br>

        23: Simula’s Test</h2>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="590" data-line-end="601">As you move through the village of Enumerant, you
        notice a short, cloaked figure following you. Not<br>
        being one to enjoy a mysterious figure tailing you, you seize a moment to confront the figure. “Don’t be<br>
        alarmed!” she says. “I am Simula. They are saying you’re a Programmer. Is this true?” You answer in the<br>
        affirmative, and Simula’s eyes widen. “If you are truly a Programmer, you will be able to help me. Follow<br>
        me.” She leads you to a backstreet and into a dimly lit hovel. She hands you a small, locked chest. “We<br>
        haven’t seen any Programmers in these lands in a long time. And especially not ones that can craft types.<br>
        If you are a True Programmer, you will want what is in that chest. And if you are a True Programmer, I<br>
        will gladly give it to you to aid you in your quest.”<br>
        The chest is a small box you can hold in your hand. The lid can be open, closed (but unlocked), or locked.<br>
        You’d normally be able to go between these states, opening, closing, locking, and unlocking the box, but<br>
        the box is broken.You need to create a program with an enumeration to recreate this locking mechanism.</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="602" data-line-end="607">The box can be in three states:<br>
        if the box is in the OPEN state, you can close it, and it becomes CLOSED<br>
        if the box is in the CLOSED state, you can open it, and it becomes OPEN<br>
        if the box is in the CLOSED state, you can lock it, and it becomes LOCKED<br>
        if the box is in the LOCKED state, you can unlock it, and it becomes CLOSED</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="608" data-line-end="610">Nothing happens if you attempt an impossible

        24: Simula’s Soup</h2>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="631" data-line-end="642">Simula is impressed with how you reconstructed
        the box with an enumeration. When the box opened,<br>
        you saw a glowing emerald gem inside. You don’t know what it is, but it seems important. Also in the box<br>
        were three vials of powder labeled HOT, SALTY, and SWEET.<br>
        “Finally! I can make soup again!” Simula says. She casually tosses the small glowing gem to you but is<br>
        wholly focused on the powders. “You stick around and help me make soup with your programming skills,<br>
        and I’ll tell you what that gem does.”<br>
        She pulls out a cookpot, knocks the clutter off the table with a quick sweep of her arm, and begins<br>
        cooking. She says, “I’m the best soup maker in town, and you’re in for a treat. I’ve got recipes for soup,<br>
        stew, and gumbo. I’ve got mushrooms, chicken, carrots, and potatoes for ingredients. And thanks to you<br>
        getting that box open, I’ve got seasonings again! Spicy, salty, and sweet seasoning. Pick a recipe, an<br>
        ingredient, and a seasoning, and I’ll make it. Use your programming skills to help us track what we make.”</p>

    <ul>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="645" data-line-end="647">Define enumerations for the three variations

        She tells you that to do this, you must gather the five keys of Object-Oriented Programming and make<br>
        your way to the Fountain of Objects, whose location is secret. She tells you you can discover its location<br>

        not for the money; I just need to be able to recoup my costs and get food on the table,” he says.<br>
        Each arrow has three parts: the arrowhead (steel, wood, or obsidian),the shaft (a length between 60 and<br>

        His costs are as follows: For arrowheads, steel costs 10 gold, wood costs 3 gold, and obsidian costs 5 gold.<br>
        For fletching, plastic costs 10 gold, turkey feathers cost 5 gold, and goose feathers cost 3 gold. For the<br>

        The color consists of three parts or channels: red, green, and blue, which indicate how much those<br>
        channels are lit up. Each channel can be from 0 to 255. 0 means completely off; 255 means completely<br>
        on.<br>
        The pedestal also includes some color names, with a set of numbers indicating their specific values for<br>
        each channel. These are commonly used colors: White (255, 255, 255), Black (0, 0, 0), Red (255, 0, 0),<br>
        Orange (255,165, 0), Yellow (255, 255, 0), Green (0, 128, 0), Blue (0, 0, 255), Purple (128, 0, 128).</p>

        defined for a legitimate password). The pedestal initially doesn’t describe any rules, but as you brush the<br>
        dust off the pedestal, it vibrates for a moment, and the following rules appear:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="812" data-line-end="813">Passwords must be at least 6 letters long
            and no more than 13 letters long.</li>

            That last rule seems random, and you wonder if the pedestal is just tormenting you with obscure rules.<br>
            You ponder for a moment about how to decide if a character is uppercase, lowercase, or a number, but<br>
            while scratching your head, you notice a piece of folded parchment on the ground near your feet. You<br>
            pick it up, unfold it, and read it:<br>

        a True Programmer can build object-oriented programs.”<br>
        More text engraved on the pedestal describes what you recognize as the game of Tic-Tac-Toe, stating<br>
        that in ancient times, inhabitants of the land would use this as a Battle of Wits to determine the outcome<br>
        of political strife. Instead of fighting wars, they would battle it out in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.<br>

    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1206" data-line-end="1217">The Fountain of Objects game is a 2D grid-based
        world full of rooms. Most rooms are empty, but a few<br>
        are unique rooms. One room is the cavern entrance. Another is the fountain room, containing the<br>
        Fountain of Objects.<br>
        The player moves through the cavern system one room at a time to find the Fountain of Objects. They<br>
        activate it and then return to the entrance room. If they do this without falling into a pit, they win the<br>
        game.<br>
        Unnatural darkness pervades the caverns, preventing both natural and human-made light. The player<br>
        must navigate the caverns in the dark, relying on their sense of smell and hearing to determine what<br>
        room they are in and what dangers lurk in nearby rooms.<br>
        This challenge serves as the basis for the other challenges in this level. It must be completed before the<br>
        others can be started. The requirements of this game are listed below.</p>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1218" data-line-end="1219"><strong>Objectives</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1220" data-line-end="1222">The world consists of a grid of rooms,
            where each room can be referenced by its row and column. Initially, the grid consists of 4 x 4 is 16
            rooms.<br>
            North is up, east is right, south is down, and west is left:</li>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1222" data-line-end="1226">The game’s flow works like this: The
            player is told what they can sense in the dark (see, hear, smell).<br>
            Then the player gets a chance to perform some action by typing it in. Their chosen action is resolved<br>
            (the player moves, state of things in the game changes, checking for a win or a loss, etc.). Then the<br>
            loop repeats.</li>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1226" data-line-end="1227">Most rooms are empty rooms, and there is
            nothing to sense.</li>

            move between them by typing commands like the<br>
            following: “move north”, “move south”, “move east”, and “move west”. The player should not be able<br>
            to move past the end of the map.</li>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1230" data-line-end="1233">The room at (Row=0, Column=0) is the

            player can sense light coming from outside the cavern when in this room. (“You see light in this room<br>
            coming from outside the cavern. This is the entrance.”)</li>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1233" data-line-end="1240">The room at (Row=0, Column=2) is the
            fountain room, containing the Fountain of Objects itself. The<br>
            Fountain can be either enabled or disabled. The player can hear the fountain but hears different<br>
            things depending on if it is on or not. (“You hear water dripping in this room. The Fountain of Objects<br>
            is here!” or “You hear the rushing waters from the Fountain of Objects. It has been reactivated!”) The<br>
            fountain is off initially. In the fountain room, the player can type “enable fountain” to enable it. If
            the<br>
            player is not in the fountain room and runs this, there should be no effect, and the player should be<br>
            told so.</li>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1240" data-line-end="1242">The player wins by moving to the fountain
            room, enabling the Fountain of Objects, and moving back<br>
            to the cavern entrance. If the player is in the entrance and the fountain is on, the player wins.</li>

        maelstrom does not result in instant death, but entering a room containing a maelstrom causes the<br>
        player to be swept away to another room. The maelstrom also moves to a new location. If the player is<br>

            boolean isEnabled, and Action ActionToPerform. Action is my interface representing any of<br>
            the action types, with implementations like DoNothingAction and AttackAction. I have a<br>
            method that creates the list of menu items, and it produces a new MenuItem instance for each<br>
            choice. The code that draws the menu iterates through the MenuItem instances and displays them<br>
            with a number. After getting the number, I find the right MenuItem, extract the Action, and return<br>
            it. That means I create many Action objects that don’t get used, but it is a system that is easy to<br>

        For example, we will give the True Programmer a defensive attack modifier called Object Sight, which<br>
        gives the character resistance to decoding damage.</p>

    <ul>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2142" data-line-end="2145">Attack data should include a damage type.
            You are free to define any damage types that you think<br>
            make sense, but include the damage types of normal (or similar) and decoding. Hint:An enumeration<br>
            might be a good choice for this.</li>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2145" data-line-end="2147">Have each attack use one of these types
            when producing damage data. Use whatever damage types<br>
            you wish, but make The Uncoded One’s unraveling attack be decoding damage.</li>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2147" data-line-end="2149">Give the True Programmer character a
            defensive attack modifier called Object Sight that reduces<br>
            decoding damage by 2.</li>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2149" data-line-end="2152">Increase the unraveling attack to deal 0
            to 4 damage randomly, instead of 0 to 2, ensuring that this<br>
            attack is the single most powerful attack in the game (but one that the hero has resistance to).</li>

    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2153" data-line-end="2159">This is perhaps the most exciting challenge:
        the one where you get to do whatever you want to the game.<br>
        This challenge is also repeatable. If you’d rather make four of your own enhancements instead of the<br>
        other challenges listed above, go for it.<br>
        Use your best judgment when awarding yourself XP, comparing what you’ve chosen with the other<br>
        challenges here.<br>
        The possibilities are limitless, but here are some ideas:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2159" data-line-end="2162">More heroes. You could add Mylara and
            Skorin, whose gear (or standard attack) is the Cannon of<br>
            Consolas, which deals 1 damage most of the time, 2 damage every multiple of 3 or 5, and 5 damage<br>
            every multiple of 3 and 5. (This adds some continuity from the early part of the book!)</li>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2162" data-line-end="2163">Add more item types. Maybe Simula’s soup
            is a full heal, restoring HP to its maximum.</li>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2163" data-line-end="2164">Add offensive attack modifiers.</li>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2164" data-line-end="2165">Let characters equip more than one piece
            of gear.</li>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2165" data-line-end="2167">Let gear provide offensive and defensive
            attack modifiers. (A Binary Helm that reduces all damage<br>
            done by 1 when equipped, for example.)</li>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2167" data-line-end="2168">Experience Points. As heroes defeat
            monsters, give them XP to track their accomplishments.</li>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2168" data-line-end="2169">More monster types.</li>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2169" data-line-end="2171">Add attack side effects, which allow an
            attack to run other logic when an attack happens. Maybe a<br>
            Shadow Octopoid with a grapple attack that has a chance of stealing equipped gear.</li>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2171" data-line-end="2172">Load levels from a file instead of
            hardcoding them in the game.</li>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2172" data-line-end="2174">Display a small indicator in the status
            display that gives you a warning if a character is close to death.<br>
            Perhaps a yellow [!] if the character is under 25% and a red [!] if the character is under 10%.</li>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2174" data-line-end="2177">Allow characters to taunt their enemies
            with messages like the Uncoded One saying &lt;&lt;THE<br>
            UNRAVELLING OF ALL THINGS IS INEVITABLE&gt;&gt; and a skeleton saying, “We will repel your<br>
            spineless assault!”</li>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2177" data-line-end="2179">Allow characters to have temporary effects
            applied to them. For example, a poison effect that deals<br>
            1 damage per turn for three turns.</li>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2179" data-line-end="2181">Strip out all Player’s Guide-specific
            elements and re-theme the game into your own creation.</li>

    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2182" data-line-end="2186">Depending on the challenges you completed, the
        game is likely not very balanced anymore. Either the<br>
        heroes or the monsters win all the time. Without changing logic and mechanics, adjust things like potion<br>
        counts, attack strengths and probabilities, the number of battles and monsters they contain to produce<br>
        a version of the game where if you play wisely, you are likely to win, but if you play poorly, you will lose.

    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2194" data-line-end="2210">You slice your sword through the smoky form of
        the Uncoded One for the last time. It begins to<br>
        disintegrate, binary streams flowing out of it until it bursts apart in a dazzling blue light. You have done<br>
        it. You have defeated the Uncoded One.<br>
        You step out of the cave’s entrance and back onto the slopes of the volcano as ash falls like snow from<br>
        the sky. Your allies have turned the tide of the battle against the Uncoded One’s minions, and they surge<br>
        through their final ranks as the remnants begin to scatter in retreat. You and your allies have saved these<br>
        realms from the grasp of the Uncoded One.<br>
        As the sun sets, alighting the ash cloud in a crimson glow, you meet up with your old friends to celebrate<br>
        with a feast. They’re all there. Vin Fletcher with his arrows. Simula with her soups. Mylara and Skorin,<br>
        with an improved cannon that helped break the Uncoded One’s lines during the battle. Everyone else<br>
        that you met as you voyaged through the Realms.<br>
        As the feast begins to wind down—and after you have had three full bowls of stew—Simula speaks to<br>
        you. “You have shown that you are, without question, a True Programmer. To me. To us. To the Uncoded<br>
        One. The power of Programming can return to these islands once again. But tell me, brave Programmer,<br>
        what will you do next?”<br>
        You take a slow, deep breath as you ponder the question before you respond.</p>
